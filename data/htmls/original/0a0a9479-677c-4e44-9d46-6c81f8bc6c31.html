This is the lowest amount paid in three decades. </span> </p> <p> Little wonder, then, that many farmers are hesitant to change their existing setup to adopt climate-forward practices, be it cover cropping, using biological inputs or participating in carbon markets. For example, just 5% of farmers surveyed by the <a href="https://zj998.keap-link008.com/v2/click/29887a3a5d65183273a8497a437f4207/eJyNkMuKwkAQRf-l1sHMJHFIshMRCVEXMq6HtrvQnkk_KKuFKPn3aR-4UnBb59Ypbp2B0QrLjYIaTr9VVUIChFJ7jZanzrKQV5gXZT4uEui0_ZuTCx7q87PdB79My2z88ZUA9x5j5Hs9mbbNav6zaFZtjHpB8cY7ns-8yorsIZotJ80ChuGlGY3m2THKD1AzBbxUUjrW4g11Mb9n9oc6TcVu5AOpgCNUIZXOGCSpRSd2EaF01pl-K8gZZKQ0ioX3aNX9LS32N_3wD0fia1w="> <span class="s2"> Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer </span> </a> last year said they planted cover crops to capture carbon. Others have referred to carbon markets as mere <a href="https://agfundernews.com/smoke-mirrors-not-worth-the-extra-cost-50-us-farmers-speak-out-on-carbon-markets"> “smoke and mirrors” </a> that are “not worth the extra cost.” </p> <p> McKinsey’s report notes that 50% of farmers “cite low ROI as a top reason for not participating in carbon programs.” Agricultural <span class="s2"> carbon credits account for just over 1% of total carbon credits issued. </span> </p> <p> Meanwhile, in the biologicals realm, <a href="https://agfundernews.com/biologicals-wont-replace-chemical-crop-inputs-anytime-soon-heres-why"> growers at the recent Salinas Biologicals Summit </a> cited economics and education as key barriers to adoption. </p> <p> While more financial incentives for ag and climate tech are now available (e.g., green premiums on consumer products, carbon and biodiversity markets), McKinsey’s report notes that these “remain nascent.” </p> <p> <span class="s2"> Access, or lack thereof, to capital can also limit any “interventions” — that is, decarbonization solutions — that require a lot of investment or take longer to reach a financial payoff. </span> </p> <p> <span class="s2"> “If this financial burden is left to the farmer, adoption is likely to be low,” notes the report </span> </p> <h4> ‘Bending the curve cost through innovation’ </h4> <p> McKinsey lays out 28 measures it says can “support on-farm decarbonization. These include, among others, biologicals, electrification of farm equipment, hydrogen power for on-farm machinery, nitrogen inhibitors and “GHG-focused breeding and genetic selection.” </p> <p> Some of the top decarbonization measures include anaerobic digestors and green fertilizers, while <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382751/"> concentrate-to-forage ratios </a> in livestock is the most cost-effective measure, according to McKinsey’s methodology. </p> <p> To achieve these things on a wide scale while also providing incentives to farmers (and, for that matter, consumers), will require enormous effort, as McKinsey suggests. </p> <div class="page" title="Page 30"> <div class="layoutArea"> <div class="column"> <p> “Continued and accelerated investment will be required to bend the cost curve for existing solutions and support the development and adoption of new solutions.” </p> </div> </div> </div> <p> McKinsey lays out a set of “sustainable-investment themes” across the food value chain it says could “help bend the cost curve for existing solutions and support the development and adoption of new solutions.” These are divided into early- or late-stage investment themes, with some appearing in both. </p> <p> Some, such as alternative protein and indoor farming, have been part of the sustainable ag conversation for a while and fall into McKinsey’s “late-stage investment” theme. Others, like digitizing commodity trading, land-based aquaculture and next-generation seeds, are in earlier investment stages. Still others — digital farm management, food waste tech — land in both. </p> <div class="page" title="Page 30"> <div class="layoutArea"> <div class="column"> <div class="page" title="Page 32"> <div class="section"> <div class="layoutArea"> <div class="column"> <p> “Although the path to achieving 1.5 ̊C will not be straightforward, it can create real business value for farmers and players throughout the value chain, with additional environmental benefits beyond reducing climate change,” the report concludes. </p> <p> “And industry players, policymakers, and investors can accelerate the path to the future while enabling their own growth.” </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
